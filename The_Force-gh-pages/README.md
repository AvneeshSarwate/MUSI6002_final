# The Force

Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes.

Force felt by [Obi-Wan Codenobi](http://shawnlawson.com) for use in live-coding performances with [The Wookie](http://ryanrosssmith.com). Together they travel as [_The Rebel Scum_](http://codenobiandwookie.com).
